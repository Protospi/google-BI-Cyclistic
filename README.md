# Cyclistic Business Intelligence Project

This project is a part of the business intelligence team's efforts at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company located in New York City. The primary goal is to analyze and monitor data from NYC Citi Bike Trips to drive business value and enhance the organization's data maturity.

## Project Background

Cyclistic has partnered with the city of New York to offer shared bikes at various stations across Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers can rent bikes for convenient travel between these stations. The Cyclistic Customer Growth Team is working on a business plan for the upcoming year. Their primary focus is understanding how customers utilize their bikes, particularly identifying customer demand at different station locations.

### Datasets

- Primary Dataset: [NYC Citi Bike Trips](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/city-of-new-york/nyc-citi-bike)
- Secondary Dataset: [Census Bureau US Boundaries](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/united-states-census-bureau/us-geographic-boundaries)

Cyclistic has collected detailed trip data, including trip start and end locations (station number and latitude/longitude), bike identification numbers, and customer type (one-time customer or subscriber). The project aims to create a dashboard summarizing key insights from millions of rides to inform the business plan.

## Stakeholders (Fictional)

- Sara Romero, VP, Marketing
- Ernest Cox, VP, Product Development

- Nina Locklear, Director, Procurement

## Team Members (Fictional)

- Adhira Patel, API Strategist
- Megan Pirato, Data Warehousing Specialist
- Rick Andersson, Manager, Data Governance
- Tessa Blackwell, Data Analyst
- Brianne Sand, Director, IT
- Shareefah Hakimi, Project Manager

## Project Approvals and Dependencies

The project may require approvals from stakeholders and teams responsible for specific product data, such as bike trip duration and identification numbers. It's important to ensure data access for all stakeholders.

## Project Goal: Grow Cyclisticâ€™s Customer Base

The project aims to understand customer preferences, the usage of current bikes, and how insights can inform the expansion of new stations. Key details from Ms. Romero include:

- Analyzing starting and ending station locations, aggregated by various criteria.
- Identifying popular destination locations based on total trip minutes.
- Focusing on trends from the summer of 2015.
- Analyzing the year-over-year growth in the number of trips.
- Gathering insights about station congestion.
- Examining the number of trips across all starting and ending locations.
- Investigating peak usage by time of day, season, and weather impact.

## Dashboard Requirements

- The dashboard should be accessible, with large print and text-to-speech alternatives.
- The project must be completed within 6 weeks.

## Measuring Success

The project will analyze data spanning at least one year to understand how seasonality affects bike usage. Other considerations include the dataset's geographic details, weather data, and the importance of anonymizing user information to protect privacy.

## People with Dashboard-Viewing Privileges

- Adhira, Brianne, Ernest, Jamal, Megan, Nina, Rick, Shareefah, Sara, Tessa

## Roll-Out Plan

- Week 1: Dataset assignment and initial field design.
- Weeks 2-3: SQL and ETL development.
- Weeks 3-4: SQL finalization, dashboard design, and the first draft review with peers.
- Weeks 5-6: Dashboard development and testing.

## Key Questions

1. How were bikes used by our customers?
2. How can we apply insights from the trip data?
